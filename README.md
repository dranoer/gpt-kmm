# GptPlus
OpenAI APIs with Kotlin Mutlti Platform


This project is a robust, feature-rich application developed to meet various user needs. It offers a clean, intuitive user interface with efficient underlying functionality.

## Technology Stack

This project uses a wide range of modern technologies, and here is the main tech stack:

- **Kotlin**: As a statically typed programming language, Kotlin provides more safety and less verbosity compared to Java, which makes the source code easier to read and write.

- **AndroidX**: AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library. It ships separately from the Android OS and provides backward compatibility across Android releases.

- **Android Compose**: This is Android's modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android.

- **Ktor**: An asynchronous framework for creating microservices. It's used for networking tasks in the project.

- **Kotlinx Coroutines**: This is a rich library for coroutines developed by JetBrains. It provides high-level coroutine-enabled primitives that can be used to model complex asynchronous computation.

- **Kotlinx Serialization**: A multiplatform serialization library made by JetBrains. Used for handling JSON data in the project.

- **Napier**: A multiplatform logger with a similar API to the popular Kotlin logging library, SLF4J.

- **Koin**: A lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin. It provides a pragmatic and concise way to manage dependencies in the project.
